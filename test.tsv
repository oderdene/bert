An image distribution system has a source that encodes digital images and transmits them over an error-prone channel to a destination. The source has an image coder that processes the digital images using vector transformation followed by vector quantization. This produces groups of vectors and quantized values that are representative of the images. The image coder orders the vectors in the codebooks and assigns vector indexes to the vectors such that a bit error occurring at a less significant bit in a vector index results in less distortion than a bit error occurring at a more significant bit. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the source and destination, the image coder may allocate different numbers of bits to different groups of vectors according to a bit allocation map for this allocation process. The source also has a UEP (Unequal Error Protection) coder that layers the vector indexes according to their significance. Two possible approaches include frequency-based UEP and bit-plane based UEP. The source transmits a bitstream that includes the image values, a bit allocation map, and the layered vector indexes. The destination receives the bitstream and recovers the vectors using the vector indexes and bit allocation map. The destination then reconstructs the image from the image values and the vectors.

Based on its superconductive properties relating to 'nonlineanty,' a conventional HTS strip is divisible into three 'domains,' namely, a medial domain and two lateral domains. The nonlinearity associated with the conventional strip's medial domain is considerably greater than that which is associated with its lateral domains. Similarly divisible into a medial domain and two lateral domains, the present invention's HTS strip uniquely exploits these physical distinctions by causing more (e.g., most) of the current that it conducts to be conducted by its lateral domains. Various inventive designs accomplish this through narrowing or interruption/punctuation (e.g., via holes and/or trenches) or degradation, or some combination thereof, of the medial domain. By thus 're-proportioning' current conduction as compared with a conventional strip, an inventive strip succeeds in 're-proportioning' the associated nonlinearities. Consequently, the total nonlinearity associated with an inventive strip is significantly lower than that which is associated with a conventional strip.

A method of forming a metal plug. First, a dielectric layer is formed on a substrate. Next, a patterned hard mask is formed on the dielectric layer. The dielectric layer is etched through the patterned hard mask to form a contact hole in the dielectric layer so as to expose parts of the substrate. An isolated layer is formed on the patterned hard mask. A barrier is then formed conformally on the isolated layer and the exposed substrate of the contact hole. A metal layer is formed to fill the contact hole and cover the barrier. A thermal treatment is performed to form a silicide between the barrier layer and the substrate. Finally, parts of the metal layer, barrier, isolated layer, and patterned hard mask are removed. The metal plug with a planar surface is thus formed in the contact hole.
