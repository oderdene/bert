Malicious software attacks (such as for example stealing data, changing data or destroying data) on personal computers and/or servers and/or other computerized gadgets (especially through the Internet) are becoming more and more common and more and more dangerous, causing damages of tens of billions of dollars each year. The state-of the-art solutions are inherently limited because they solve onl y a limited number of problems on the surface, instead of going deeply into the roots of the problem. The most common solutions are Anti-viruses and firewalls. Anti- viruses are limited because they can only detect known viruses or worms that have alread y been identified (usually after they have already attacked many computers). Networ k firewalls are typically based on packet filtering, which is limited in principle, since the rules of which packets to accept or not may contain for example subjecti ve decisions based on trusting certain sites or certain applications. However, once security is breached for any reason, for example due to an error or intended deception, a hostile application may take over the computer or server or the entire network and create unlimited damages (directly or by opening the door to additional malicious applications). They are also not effective against security holes for exampl e in browsers or e-mail programs or in the operating system itself. According to an article in ZDnet from Jan 24, 2001, security holes in critical applications are discovered so often that just keeping up with all the patches is impractical. Also, withou t proper generic protection for example against Trojan horses, which can identify any malicious program without prior knowledge about it, even VPNs (Virtual Priva te Networks) and other form of data encryption, including digital signatures, a re not really safe because the info can be stolen before or below the encryption. Even personal firewalls are typically limited, because once a program is allowed to access the Internet, there are no other limitations for example on what files it ma y access and send or what it might do. The present invention creates a general generic comprehensive solution by going deeply into the roots of the problem. One of the biggest absurdities of the state-of the-art situation is that by default programs are allowed to do whatever they like to other programs or to their data files or to critical files of the operating system, which is as absurd as letting a guest in a hotel bother any other guests as he pleases, steal their property or copy it or destroy it, destroy their rooms, etc., or for example have free access to the hotel's safe or electron ic switchboard or phone or elevator control room. The present concept is based on automatic segregation between programs: It is like limiting each guest by default to his room and limiting by default his access to the Hotel's strategic resources, so that only by explicit permission each guest can get additional privileges.</SDOAB >	G,H

A multi-hop wireless Ad-Hoc network according to the present invention employs a voice reservation protocol. The protocol supports voice and data communication and incorporates retransmission and acknowledgement mechanisms. A TDMA frame architecture is dynamically selected depending on voice mode operation (e.g., simplex/duplex) and associated retransmission/acknowledgement mechanisms. A source node transmits a reservation packet that embeds TDMA frame architecture and other information. The packet is transmitted to a destination node and is further piggybacked on existing neighbor discovery packets to reduce overhead. Each intermediate network node along the propagation path determines the manner in which to accomplish slot reservation based on the embedded information in the reservation packet. The protocol may use separate dedicated channels or a single channel for voice and data, and supports voice/data load balancing over different channels. In addition, the protocol may utilize speech silence and increased communication reliability to enhance performance.	H

A method for dynamically self-assembling and executing software is provided, containing machines that self-assemble execution sequences and data structures. In addition to ordered functions calls (found commonly in other software methods), mutual selective bonding between bonding sites of machines actuates one or more of the bonding machines. Two or more machines can be virtually isolated by a construct, called an encapsulant, containing a population of machines and potentially other encapsulants that can only bond with each other.

Bonding between machines' sites can be deterministic or stochastic with bonding triggering a sequence of actions that can be implemented by each machine. A self-assembled execution sequence occurs as a sequence of stochastic binding between machines followed by their deterministic actuation. It is the sequence of bonding of machines that determines the execution sequence, so that the sequence of instructions need not be contiguous in memory.	G

The present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for producing metal, primarily aluminium, through a gas anode system using reducing gases. The gas anode system has been created not only to carry electrical current, but also to convey and distribute reducing gas, for instance, natural gas to the anode - electrolyte interface. The anode is made of electrically conductive materials, preferentially, graphite or carbon based materials with connecting pores or channels for gas distribution in high temperature applications. However, the carbon anode itself is not normally involved in the anodic reaction. The manner of the distribution of the reducing gas enables protection of the carbon anode from the anodic oxidation. The invention renders possible a more effective, environment-friendly aluminium reduction process with reduced CO2 emission and lower consumption of the anode materials. The invention can also extend to other metals reduction processes where said reducing gas is involved.	C

Based on motion estimation and time-domain filtering, the invention carries out blocks of image and rebuilds coded image and adjusts filtering intensity in self-adaptation based on matching error. Experiment shows that the invention provides high quality in subjective assessment under certain transmission speed, and reduced compact code rate under same quality of image.	H

The retinal prosthesis test device is comprised of a thin wafer of glass made from nanochannel glass (NGC) with very small channels perpendicular to the plane of the wafer filled with an electrical conductor forming microwires. One surface of the glass is ground to a spherical shape consistent with the radius of curvature of the inside of the retina. The NGC is hybridized to a silicon de-multiplexer and a video image is serially input to a narrow, flexible micro-cable and read into a 2-D array of unit cells in a pixel-by-pixel manner which samples the analog video input and stores the value as a charge on a MOS capacitor. After all unit cells have been loaded with the pixel values for the current frame, a biphasic pulse is sent to each unit cell which modulates the pulse in proportion to the pixel value stored therein. Because the biphasic pulses flow in parallel to each unit cell from a global external connection, the adjacent retinal neurons are all stimulated simultaneously, analogous to image photons stimulating photoreceptors in a normal retina. A permanent retinal implant device uses a NGC array hybridized to a silicon chip, the image is simultaneously generated within each cell through a photon-to-electron conversion using a silicon photodiode. The photons propagate directly through into the backside of the device. Electrical power and any control signals are transmitted through an inductively driven coil or antenna on the chip. The device collects the charge in storage capacitors via the photon-to-electron conversion process, stimulates the neural tissue with biphasic pulses in proportion to the stored charges, and resets the storage capacitors to repeat the process.
